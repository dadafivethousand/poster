// OpenHouseIcons.js — the drawn icon set for the open house poster.
//
// Not placeholders. These are the poster's icons, drawn here so the whole
// sheet is one file with nothing to go missing before a print run, and every
// one is still overridable by passing a src for that slot.
//
// ── THEY TAKE THEIR COLOUR FROM WHERE THEY SIT ──
//
// The previous set hard-coded a colour into every icon: a brown dirt block, a
// green calendar, a purple clock, a blue printer, a navy bag. Nothing agreed
// with anything, and the two icons that landed on a yellow tab had to be drawn
// twice to stay legible.
//
// Now the mass of every icon is `currentColor` and the detail cut into it is
// `--ink`, so an icon is legible wherever it is put and the parent decides:
//
//     .oh-tab           color:#fff   --ink: the tab's own hue
//     .oh-tab--yellow   color:navy   --ink:#fff        (white washes out on yellow)
//     .oh-program       color:#fff   --ink: navy       (on the dark panel)
//     .oh-foot          color:lime   --ink: navy
//
// That is one drawing per idea instead of two, and it is why the row finally
// reads as a set.
//
// ── NO PARTNER LOGOS ARE DRAWN ──
//
// The old set had a recognisable Minecraft grass block and a Roblox tile —
// reproductions of other companies' marks on a piece of advertising. The names
// stay on the poster as TEXT, which is nominative use and is how you are
// allowed to say what you teach; the icons beside them are generic, so they
// read as "block-building games" without impersonating either brand.
//
// Drawn on a 64 grid, flat, one idea each: read at 44–88px on a busy field,
// where a detailed drawing turns to mush.
