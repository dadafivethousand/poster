// MapleBackToSchool.js — Maple Jiu Jitsu back-to-school offer, Instagram post.
//
// Recreated from ~/Downloads/"maple back to school special.PNG", which had no
// source. Deep navy field, the leaf mark up top, a stacked condensed headline
// with SPECIAL knocked out of a white slab, a bonus-value roundel, three
// numbered offer cards and the sign-up block.
//
// The two product shots in the original — a branded gi and branded gloves —
// are EMOJI here at the user's direction. That is a deliberate trade: the
// photographs carried Maple patches, so reproducing them would mean sourcing
// and retouching artwork for a post that reads fine with a glyph. It also
// keeps the sheet self-contained: no photography to re-license or re-shoot
// when a value changes.
//
// EVERY NUMBER IS A PROP. $120, $50, $169, "over $300", the address and the
// domain are the club's claims, not this file's. The three values sum to $339,
// which is what "over $300" is standing on — change one and check the other
// still holds.
